## How We Built It

1. **Data Collection & Preparation**  
   Gathered historical sales and customer data from the companyâ€™s database and cleaned it for analysis, ensuring data consistency and accuracy.

2. **Dashboard Design & KPI Selection**  
   Defined key performance indicators (KPIs) including total sales, profits, quantity sold, customer count, and average sales per customer. Focused on metrics that drive business value.

3. **Implementation in Tableau**  
   - Created visualizations for monthly and weekly trends using line and bar charts.  
   - Developed comparison views for year-over-year sales and profits.  
   - Designed interactive filters to allow stakeholders to drill down by product subcategory, time period, and customer segments.  
   - Incorporated highlights to identify high and low performance periods for quick insights.

4. **Testing & Feedback**  
   Conducted multiple iterations incorporating feedback from sales managers and marketing teams to improve clarity, usability, and performance.
