# Sales & Customer Analysis Dashboards – Tableau

This project involves creating two interactive Tableau dashboards designed to provide insightful analysis on sales performance and customer behavior. These dashboards enable stakeholders to monitor key metrics, identify trends, and make data-driven decisions to improve business outcomes.

## Project Overview

The project is divided into two primary dashboards:

- **Sales Dashboard:** Visualizes sales KPIs, year-over-year trends, product subcategory comparisons, and weekly sales & profit patterns.
- **Customer Dashboard:** Tracks customer growth, average sales per customer, number of orders, and monthly customer trends.

## How We Built It

1. **Data Collection & Preparation**  
   Gathered historical sales and customer data from the company’s database and cleaned it for analysis, ensuring data consistency and accuracy.

2. **Dashboard Design & KPI Selection**  
   Defined key performance indicators (KPIs) including total sales, profits, quantity sold, customer count, and average sales per customer. Focused on metrics that drive business value.

3. **Implementation in Tableau**  
   - Created visualizations for monthly and weekly trends using line and bar charts.  
   - Developed comparison views for year-over-year sales and profits.  
   - Designed interactive filters to allow stakeholders to drill down by product subcategory, time period, and customer segments.  
   - Incorporated highlights to identify high and low performance periods for quick insights.

4. **Testing & Feedback**  
   Conducted multiple iterations incorporating feedback from sales managers and marketing teams to improve clarity, usability, and performance.
